This is a demo from my Text based adventure using OOP from my Y12 which includes the game mechanics but lacks story. These mechanics include an open world system through coordinates and an item system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas I wanted to include:
- A counter for each room to show how many times a player has entered that room. This is useful for first time entry messages of each room. Could be implemented as a 2d array in the Places dictionary, first array showing the items in the room and second array being the counter. I sort of made use of this temporarily for the counter on poop so it doesn't print out 'you noticed some poop' multiple times.

- Sub classes for items - Consumable and unusuable objects. For example, examining a potion (showing description and value) is different to consuming it.
